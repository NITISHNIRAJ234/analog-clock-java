# analog-clock-java
The analog clock project using Java and NetBeans IDE involves creating a GUI for an analog clock that displays the current time. Components such as JFrames, JPanel, JLabel, and Graphics2D are used to create the clock face and hands. The clock is continuously updated by fetching the current time and using a timer to repaint the clock every second.
